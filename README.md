# Django+React Deloyed To Heroku
This project is based on [here](https://github.com/zachtylr21/django-react-starter) which I used to modify and add the ability to view images along with text to the React app portion of the app when using a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

The major achievenment of this app is to deploy a Django+React project to Heroku. It is currently live on [Heroku](https://cm-react-test6.herokuapp.com/)
