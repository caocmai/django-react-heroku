# Django+React Deployed To Heroku
This project is based on [here](https://github.com/zachtylr21/django-react-starter) which I used to modify and add the ability to apply CSS, use Bootstrap, view images along with text to the React app portion of this Django project.

The major achievement of this app is successful deployment of a Django+React project to Heroku. It is currently live on [Heroku](https://cm-react-test6.herokuapp.com/), which was accomplished using a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Prerequisites
Must have [Django v3.1.1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/) and [Node.js v12.19.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, preferably in a virtual environment(virtualENV or pipENV)

## To Run Locally
After you clone the project, navigate to the root of the project and run the following commands into the terminal:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```
Go to your browser and in the address bar type in: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## To Upload Project to Your Heroku
I'm assuming you know how to deploy a simple Django project to Heroku. Below are added instructions to deploy a Djano+React (this project) to Heroku.

To get a Django+React project deployed, Heroku needs a build pack of `nodejs` as well as `python` so when you run  `$ heroku buildpack` after you created your Heroku app you should see something like:
```
1. heroku/nodejs
2. heroku/python
```

If you don't have something like that, to add both the build packs to your Heroku App run:
```
$ heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs
$ heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 heroku/python
```

Alternatively, you can find your app's build packs under the Settings option within your app's console on `heroku.com` and add the necessary build packs there.
